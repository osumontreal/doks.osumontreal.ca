# This workflow makes sure the website builds without error on `pushes` to the
# `main` branch and on `pull requests` that are opened to the `main` branch.
# Automatically builds and deploys to the `gh-pages` branch only when PRs
# are merged and pass all the checks.
# A cname file is added to gh-pages branch to use a custom domain.
